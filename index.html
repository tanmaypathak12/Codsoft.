    <h2>👋 About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Hi, I'm <strong>Tanmay Pathak</strong> from Noida, a second-year B.Tech Computer Science student at <strong>Galgotias University</strong>, driven by a burning curiosity for how things work — especially in the world of software and engineering.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ever since I wrote my first "Hello, World!" in C, I've been fascinated by the way code can build, break, and rebuild the world around us. From Java classes to JavaScript functions, I'm always experimenting with ideas and building things that *solve real-life problems*.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside academics, I actively participate in internships, explore AI tools like OpenAI API, and dive into GitHub repos like treasure hunts. I believe the best engineers are <em>builders first, learners always</em>.

    <h2>🚀 Projects That Define Me</h2>

    <h3>🧠 AI Quiz Generator</h3>
    <p>
      Not your average quiz app — it uses OpenAI to generate custom questions on the fly based on topic and difficulty. I built this to challenge myself with APIs, and it turned out to be super fun!
    </p>

    <h3>📅 Age Calculator</h3>
    <p>
      Sleek and modern with a dark mode, this project helped me understand DOM, event handling, and user experience. It even has a birthday countdown!
    </p>

    <h3>🎮 Tic Tac Toe (Web + CLI)</h3>
    <p>
      A game I built in both JavaScript (for UI) and Python (as a terminal app). I explored win-check algorithms, event handling, and reset functionality.
    </p>

    <h3>🏓 Ping Pong Game</h3>
    <p>
      A mini JS game where physics meets fun. Paddle movement, collision detection, and scorekeeping — all coded from scratch.
    </p>

    <h3>💬 AI Quote Generator</h3>
    <p>
      Tiny but impactful — generates random motivational quotes using JS and a sprinkle of creativity.
